                Big Lagoon is one of the most iconic lagoons in El Nido, on Miniloc Island. Surrounded by towering limestone cliffs, crystal-clear turquoise water, and dramatic scenery, it&apos;s often featured in traveler&apos;s &quot;must-see&quot; lists. The lagoon opens through a narrow channel; large boats can&apos;t go in fully, so visitors usually dock and then kayak or swim inside. It&apos;s serene, photogenic, and gives a mix of awe, peace, and adventure.

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expect clear blue-green waters, limestone cliffs that feel dramatic and imposing, and a bit of crowd especially in mid-morning. The entrance to the lagoon may be narrow; during low tide, boats may not go all the way and you&apos;ll need to kayak or swim in from docking points. Boat rides can be bumpy depending on sea conditions. The scenery is often stunning beyond expectations.

            <p class="important-details-text">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Big Lagoon is part of a protected marine area, meaning there are strict environmental regulations—no littering, feeding fish, or taking corals. Cellular signal is weak or nonexistent, so prepare for a digital detox while reconnecting with nature. There are no restrooms or food stalls within the lagoon itself, so bring your essentials before boarding the boat. Don&apos;t forget waterproof bags to protect your gadgets, extra drinking water, and a dry towel for after your swim. Lastly, remember that the beauty of Big Lagoon lies in its untouched nature—so take only pictures, leave only footprints, and make the most of your winning escape in paradise.

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kayaking is the main highlight at Big Lagoon, letting you paddle through serene emerald waters surrounded by majestic limestone cliffs. You can also swim in certain shallow parts, snorkel near the entrance, or take stunning drone and GoPro shots for that picture-perfect travel memory. Many visitors enjoy combining Big Lagoon with nearby destinations like Small Lagoon, Secret Lagoon, and Shimizu Island as part of their island-hopping adventure. For a more relaxed pace, simply float and take in the stillness of nature—a moment of calm that perfectly captures what Palawan is all about.

                <p class="fun-fact-text">
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Big Lagoon&apos;s water color changes throughout the day depending on the sunlight and tides, creating a dynamic palette from turquoise to deep jade. Because of its ecological importance, only a limited number of boats are allowed each day, and most tours require guests to switch to kayaks to minimize coral damage. Early morning visits are best for photography as the water is calm and the crowds are fewer. It&apos;s also said that the lagoon&apos;s deep center hides an ancient underwater cave system, making it a mysterious yet enchanting part of Palawan&apos;s natural heritage.
